# Pushes sdk/swift to the hausfold/scruff-swift mirror via `git subtree split`,
# since SwiftPM needs Package.swift at a repo's root for a remote git
# dependency (see this dir's README's "Install" section).
#
# Two callers, one code path:
#
#   sdk/swift/sync-mirror.sh              from main, by hand — mirror main only.
#                                         Use it to get an unreleased change in
#                                         front of a consumer pinning a branch.
#   sdk/swift/sync-mirror.sh --tag 0.2.0  what release.yml runs at a v* tag:
#                                         mirror the tree AND tag it, which is
#                                         the whole of "publishing" for SwiftPM
#                                         (there is no registry to push to — a
#                                         tag on the mirror IS the release).
#
# Run from the scruff repo root. Auth comes from MIRROR_URL, which CI overrides
# with a credential-bearing URL because the workflow's own GITHUB_TOKEN is
# scoped to THIS repo and cannot push to the mirror.
